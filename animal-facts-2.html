                <p><strong>1. Giraffes have the same number of neck bones as humans.</strong><br>
                    Both have seven vertebrae in the neck — giraffes’ are just much bigger.</p>

                <p><strong>2. A snail can sleep for up to three years.</strong><br>
                    In very dry conditions, some snails enter a deep sleep to survive.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Crows hold grudges.</strong><br>
                    They remember human faces and can pass “bad” faces on to other crows.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Penguins propose with a rock.</strong><br>
                    Some male penguins look for the “perfect” pebble to offer a female.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Sea otters hold hands when they sleep.</strong><br>
                    They do it so they don’t drift apart while floating in the water.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Koalas have fingerprints like humans.</strong><br>
                    Under a microscope, their prints can be confusing even for forensic experts.</p>

                <p><strong>7. Some goats faint when they get scared.</strong><br>
                    “Fainting goats” have a genetic condition that stiffens their muscles.</p>

                <p><strong>8. Parrots name their babies.</strong><br>
                    Wild parrots use specific calls that function like names for their chicks.</p>

                <p><strong>9. Axolotls can regrow entire limbs — even parts of their heart.</strong><br>
                    Their regeneration skills are so strong scientists study them for medicine.</p>
