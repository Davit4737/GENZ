                <p><strong>1. Your brain edits your vision every time you move your eyes.</strong><br>
                    Tiny jumps called saccades happen constantly, but you never see the “blur”.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Your brain is wired to notice negative things more than positive ones.</strong><br>
                    This “negativity bias” helped humans survive, but makes modern life feel heavier.</p>

                <p><strong>3. You can only actively focus on one thing at a time.</strong><br>
                    “Multitasking” is your brain just switching focus very fast and losing efficiency.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Your brain sometimes decides before you feel like you chose.</strong><br>
                    In some experiments, brain activity predicts a choice milliseconds before you’re aware of it.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Your handwriting uses more of your brain than typing.</strong><br>
                    That’s why writing things down by hand helps you remember them better.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Your brain fills in blind spots you don’t even know you have.</strong><br>
                    There are areas in your vision with no data — your brain just invents what “should” be there.</p>

                <p><strong>7. Social rejection activates the same brain areas as physical pain.</strong><br>
                    That “it actually hurts” feeling? Your brain treats it like real pain.</p>
