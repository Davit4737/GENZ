                <p><strong>1. In space, metal pieces can weld together without heat.</strong><br>
                    In a vacuum, two clean pieces of the same metal can fuse on contact. It’s called cold welding.</p>

                <p><strong>2. There is alcohol in space.</strong><br>
                    A giant cloud of alcohol (and other molecules) was found near the center of our galaxy.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Saturn would float in water — if you had a big enough pool.</strong><br>
                    Its average density is lower than water’s.</p>

                <p><strong>4. The footprints on the Moon are still there.</strong><br>
                    There’s no wind or rain to erase them, so they can last millions of years.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Space isn’t completely silent.</strong><br>
                    Sound can’t travel in a vacuum, but waves and vibrations can still be detected and “translated” into sound.</p>

                <p><strong>6. There are planets that orbit two stars at once.</strong><br>
                    Like Tatooine from Star Wars — except these are real.</p>

                <p><strong>7. Some stars are so dense that a sugar-cube size piece would weigh billions of tons.</strong><br>
                    Neutron-star matter is insanely compact.</p>

                <p><strong>8. We are literally made of stardust.</strong><br>
                    Many of the elements in your body were formed inside stars that exploded long before you were born.</p>
