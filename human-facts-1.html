                <p><strong>1. Your brain sometimes makes up memories.</strong><br>
                    You can strongly “remember” things that never happened exactly the way you think.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Your brain can't tell the difference between real and imagined practice.</strong><br>
                    Visualizing yourself doing something activates many of the same brain areas as actually doing it.</p>

                <p><strong>3. You see your nose all the time — your brain just edits it out.</strong><br>
                    Your brain constantly deletes “useless” information from your vision.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Your brain rewrites the past to make your decisions feel logical.</strong><br>
                    After you choose something, your brain shifts your memory so it looks like you “always wanted that”.</p>

                <p><strong>5. When you're tired, you get more emotional, not just sleepy.</strong><br>
                    Lack of sleep hits the emotional centers of your brain first.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Your brain loves stories more than facts.</strong><br>
                    That's why you remember stories years later and forget random information in minutes.</p>

                <p><strong>7. Your brain is only about 2% of your body weight — but uses ~20% of your energy.</strong><br>
                    Thinking is literally expensive for your body.</p>
